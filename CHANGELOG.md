Yii Framework 2 imagine extension Change Log
================================================

2.3.0 under development
-----------------------

- Enh #28: `Image::thumbnail()` now accepts flag `ImageInterface::THUMBNAIL_FLAG_UPSCALE` to allow thumbnail upscaling. Since this option is only supported in imagine/imagine v1.0.0 or later, support for older version was dropped (yuniorsk)


2.2.0 June 04, 2019
-------------------

- Enh #54: Updated imagine/imagine version constraint to allow using 1.1.0 (samdark)

2.1.0 November 3, 2016
----------------------

- Enh #11: Resources are now supported as image files (samdark)
- Enh #20: Upgraded the imagine library from 0.5.x to 0.6.x.
      In order to upgrade to 0.6.x the color behavior had to be
      changed. In addition a new `autorotate` method has been implemented
      in order to rotate images based in the EXIF informations provided
      inside the image (nadar)

2.0.4 September 4, 2016
-----------------------

- Enh #3: `Image::thumbnail()` could now automatically calculate thumbnail dimensions based on aspect ratio of original
  image if only width or only height is specified. `Image::$thumbnailBackgroundColor` and
  `Image::$thumbnailBackgroundAlpha` are introduced to be able to configure fill color of thumbnails (HaruAtari, samdark)
